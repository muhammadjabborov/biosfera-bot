# Referral System Documentation

## Overview
The referral system allows confirmed teachers to earn points by referring other users to the bot. When users reach a certain point threshold, they receive invite links to channels.

## How It Works

### 1. Referral Process
- When a user starts the bot with a referral parameter (e.g., `/start 123456789`), the system checks if the referrer exists
- If the referrer is a confirmed teacher, they receive 1 point for each successful referral
- Users cannot refer themselves
- Each user can only be referred once

### 2. Points System
- Points are only awarded to confirmed teachers (`is_confirmed=True`)
- Points are stored in the `Point` model
- The point threshold for receiving invite links is configurable via the `PointScore` model

### 3. Invite Links
- When a user reaches the point threshold, they automatically receive invite links to configured channels
- Links are sent only once per user (tracked by `LinkGot` model)
- Channel information is stored in the `ChannelID` model

## Models

### Point
- `user`: ForeignKey to User
- `points`: IntegerField (default: 0)

### PointScore
- `points`: IntegerField (default: 0) - threshold for invite links

### LinkGot
- `user`: ForeignKey to User
- `is_get`: BooleanField (default: False) - tracks if user received links

### Referral
- `referrer`: ForeignKey to User (who referred)
- `referee`: ForeignKey to User (who was referred)

### ChannelID
- `channel_name`: CharField - display name for the channel
- `channel_id`: CharField - Telegram channel ID

## Setup Instructions

### 3. Configure Channels (via Admin)
1. Go to Django Admin
2. Add channels in the "Channel IDs" section
